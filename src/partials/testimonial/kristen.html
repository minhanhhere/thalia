      I had the pleasure of teaching Thalia Nguyen in the Business Communications course at Saskatchewan Polytechnic, and I remember her as a thoughtful,
      hardworking, and genuinely kind student. Thalia consistently approached her work with care and professionalism, participating fully in class and
      demonstrating a sincere commitment to improving her communication skills. Her written work was well-organized and clear, and she delivered her
      presentations with confidence and warmth. Thalia is the kind of person who contributes positively to any team environmentâ€”reliable, respectful, and eager
      to learn. I'm confident she will bring the same dedication and integrity to any role she pursues.
